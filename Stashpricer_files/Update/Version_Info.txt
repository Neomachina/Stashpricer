Version: dev.00.04

Done with the Launcher! (Well, maybe I could integrate some of the yes/no messages into the UI, but eh.)

Now it's time to start working on the main script 
(and only maybe still devote some time every now and then to improve on the launcher)

Will have to scrap the old iterations, polish the pieces, make some entirely new pieces, and build something nice out of it all. 
That, and design the UI elements.... might be some time. But progress is being made!
