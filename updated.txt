File meant to be used for handling updates. Not much to see here in this case.
Honestly, if you're even able to see this (unless you're browsing the GitHub), either something went wrong, or you are using one of the earliest versions available to the public, or I forgot to do something I should have. Contact me if you think it matters. If you managed to read this you should know how to.
