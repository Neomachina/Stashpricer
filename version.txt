Version: dev.00.03

Still working on the Launcher primarily.  
Trying to get it to work with the changelog. 
Should be done with that tomorrow (12.07)?
EDIT: I worked through the night, it's 5 in the morning, but at least it looks like it's properly compiling the changelog data.
All that's missing now is setting it up to dowload based on the data - indefinite downward compatibility achieved.
