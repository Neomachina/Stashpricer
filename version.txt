Version:  dev.00.02

Done for the day. Launcher seems to be working just fine.
I can copy a lot of code, but oh my god is the old stuff awfull.
Glad I decided to take a break and restructure it all. 

Should be done with the new Launcher/Updater in tommorow.

Next up is the basic GUI, THEN the actual stash management based on it.

Had that out of order last time, which made trying to work with the code hopeless.
