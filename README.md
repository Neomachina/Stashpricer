# Stashpricer
PoE tool meant to work with information provided by GGG's API and the API provided by poeprices.info to price stashed items.
The current version (dev.04.05/dev.04.04) has no actual features, although it should retrieve and display information on stashed items.
The developer exclusive version already has functional pricing of stashed items.
