# Stashpricer
Currently rebuilding the tool for version dev.05! Trying to update/ download atm would probably result in a broken mess.
PoE tool meant to work with information provided by GGG's API and the API provided by poeprices.info to price stashed items.
The current version (dev.04.05/dev.04.04) is still missing an actual GUI.
