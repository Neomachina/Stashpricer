# Stashpricer
PoE tool meant to work with information provided by GGG's API and the API provided by poeprices.info to price stashed items.
The current version (dev.04.01/dev.04.00) has no actual features.
The developer exclusive version already has functional pricing of stashed items. 
This is not included in the public version as it recquires many user-unfriendly tweaks.
My goal is to get this done soon, and it should get done in time, so just have patience.
